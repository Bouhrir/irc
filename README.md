# introduction

The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol has been designed over a number of years, with multitudes of implementations and use cases appearing. This document describes the IRC Client-Server protocol.

IRC is a text-based chat protocol which has proven itself valuable and useful. It is well-suited to running on many machines in a distributed fashion. A typical setup involves multiple servers connected in a distributed network. Messages are delivered through this network and state is maintained across it for the connected clients and active channels.

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119.

## IRC Protocol Overview

A brief overview of the Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol, including key concepts, features, and usage.


## About the IRC Protocol

The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol enables real-time, text-based communication between users over the Internet. Developed in the late 1980s, IRC remains one of the oldest and simplest forms of online chat systems. It operates on a client-server model, where users connect to IRC servers, join channels, and communicate with each other.

## Key Concepts

### IRC Server

- An IRC network consists of one or more servers responsible for managing connections, channels, and user communication within their domain.
- Users connect to an IRC server using an IRC client.

### IRC Client

- An IRC client is a software application that users use to connect to an IRC server, providing a user interface for interacting with the IRC network.
- Examples of IRC clients include mIRC, HexChat, XChat, irssi, and others.

### Channels

- Channels are virtual rooms or discussion groups where users can communicate.
- Each channel has a unique name, usually preceded by the '#' symbol (e.g., #programming).
- Users can join or leave channels to participate in discussions on specific topics.

### Nicknames

- Each user on an IRC network is identified by a nickname (nick), which is unique within a specific server.
- Users can change their nicknames, helping others identify and address them.

### Modes

- IRC channels and users can have various modes controlling their behavior.
- For example, a channel can be set to invite-only or moderated, and users can be set to operator status with additional privileges.

### Commands

- Users interact with the IRC server and channels using commands.
- Common commands include joining a channel (`/join`), leaving a channel (`/part`), changing nickname (`/nick`), sending a private message (`/msg`), and others.

### Messages

- Communication on IRC occurs through messages, which can be sent to channels or directly to other users.
- Channels and private messages use different syntax, often beginning with the target (channel or user) followed by the message content.

### IRC Operators

- Some users have special privileges and responsibilities as IRC operators (op).
- They can moderate channels, kick or ban users, and perform administrative tasks.

### Bot

- IRC bots are automated programs that can perform various tasks, such as moderating channels, providing information, or running games.
